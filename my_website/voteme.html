    <h1>Here's why you should vote me for Senior Class President</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I have been in leadership since 8th grade.</p>
    <p>   I have knowledge on starting fundraisers and getting events aproved. I am also familiar with things that we can and cannot sell on campus, so we will be sure that our fundraisers won't be turned down. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I know the school.</p>
    <p>   I have been working in this building since June 12, which has led me to learn the whole layout of the new campus. I know who has any of the things that me may need, like if we need posters, ladders, or a trip to the roof for some reason. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I have very little social life.</p>
    <p>   There will be nothing to distract me from my duties as class president, so I can devote more time to getting kids what they want - like an off campus lunch for seniors. </p>
